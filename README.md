# Flutter Mini Projects - Challenge Series

This repository contains a series of mini Flutter projects created as part of a challenge series to practice interactive UI, animations, and state management.

## Challenge 1: Draggable Color Matching

**Description:**  
Use `Draggable` and `DragTarget` widgets to create a mini physics simulation where users can drag colored balls into matching colored containers.

**Features:**  
- Three draggable colored balls (red, green, blue)  
- Matching colored drop targets/containers  
- Visual feedback during dragging  
- Success state when correct matches are made  
- Handles both correct and incorrect drops  

## Challenge 2: Advanced Animation Chain

**Description:**  
Create a widget that uses `AnimationController` with multiple `Tween` animations to create a loading sequence with 3 dots that scale and fade in sequence.

**Features:**  
- Proper `AnimationController` setup with disposal  
- Sequential animations for 3 dots  
- Includes both scale and opacity animations  
- Continuous looping animation  
- Smooth curves for natural animation  

## Challenge 3: Task Management Widget

**Description:**  
Create a task management widget using `Dismissible` combined with `ReorderableListView`. Users can swipe to delete tasks and drag to reorder them, with confirmation dialogs and undo functionality.

**Features:**  
- Swipe-to-delete tasks using `Dismissible`  
- Drag-to-reorder tasks using `ReorderableListView`  
- Confirmation dialog before deletion  
- Undo functionality using `SnackBar`
